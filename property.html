	<b>Examples of <i>intellectual property theft</i> in the past with the absence of technology</b><br>
	In 1994, Adidas and Payless got into a scuffle over stripes. Adidas had used its three-stripe mark as a logo of sorts since 1952, and had <br>
	recently registered it as a trademark. But Payless was selling similar athletic shoes with two and four parallel stripes. The two companies <br>
	made a settlement, but by 2001, Payless was again selling the look-alikes. Fearing that the sneakers would dupe buyers and tarnish its name, <br>
	Adidas America Inc. demanded a jury trial. The trial lasted seven years, during which 268 pairs of Payless shoes were reviewed. In the end, <br>
	Adidas was awarded $305 million-$100 million for each stripe (Gambino, 2011).

    Software companies should have a license key which gives an authorized user/purchaser a data string that, upon installation, unlocks a software
	product and makes it available for use. These companies can also encrypt the source code within an application to prevent reverse engineering and theft. 
	
	<br> <br>
	<b>How can <i>manufacturing of counterfeit products </i> be mitigated with the use of technology?</b><br>
	Manufacturing of counterfeit products is a type of intellectual property crime. Various apps are used as tools for companies and customers to fight <br>

	<br> <br>
	<b> What are actions/responses that may mitigate the effect of technology on <i>burglary</i> ? </b><br>

	Carjacking - When a person takes a vehicle through force, violent acts or the threat of intimidation, a person has committed the crime of carjacking 
	("Crime of Carjacking," n.d). This can be mitigated by using GPS tracking to locate where a car is going and where it went so people will think twice <br>
