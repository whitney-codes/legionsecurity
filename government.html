	<b>Three types of crimes against individuals include: </b><br>
	<ul>
	<li>Terrorism</li><br>
	<li>Sedition</li><br>

	<h2 id="top" >Terrorism</h2>
	<p> 
	
	<b>Definition of <i>terrorism</i> according to Collins Dictionary:</b><br>
	Terrorism is the use of violence, especially murder and bombing, in order to achieve political aims or to force a government to do something.
	<br> <br> 
	<b>Examples of <i>terrorism</i> crimes in the past with the absence of technology</b><br>
	Terrorism is not a 21st century phenomenon and has roots in early resistance and political movements. The Sicarii were an early Jewish terrorist <br> 
	organization founded in the first century AD with the goal of overthrowing the Romans in the Middle East. Judas of Galilee, leader of the Zealots <br>
	and a influence on the Sicarii, believed that the Jews should be ruled by God alone and that armed resistance was necessary (Roser, Nagdy & Ritchie, 2018).

	<b>How have technology evolved the way <i>terrorism </i> is committed?</b><br>
	Cyberterrorism is defined as the use of the Internet as a way to launch an attack (Kaplan, 2009). The internet has allowed terrorist organizations to 
	communicate their message and aims to the world, allowing them to recruit new members, coordinate global attacks and evade surveillance. The terrorist 
	group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) are one of the first to use the power of the internet and social media (Roser, Nagdy & Ritchie, 2018).
	<br> <br>
	<b> What are actions/responses that may mitigate the effect of technology on <i>terrorism</i> ? </b><br>
	As detailed by Beggs, & Butler (2004), current technologies such as firewalls, password protection systems, key encryption (e.g 3DES, RSA), stenography 
	and intrusion detection systems are being use to mitigate the effect of cyberterrorism.
	
	<br> <br>
	<b>How can <i>hacking</i> be mitigated with the use of technology?</b><br>
	Homemade bombs, are the weapons for terrorists and greatest cause of casualties in terrorist attacks. To address this threat, North Atlantic Treaty <br>
	Organization (NATO) is developing a variety of technologies to cause the bombs to malfunction (Billingslea, 2004). Other technologies such critical <br>
	infrastructure inspection management system (CIIMS) allows the government to conduct surveillance which can send and receive real-time information <br>
	about activities on the ground help to prevent terrorist attacks (Crawford, 2011).
	<br> <br> <br>
	
	<h2 id = "middle">Sedition</h2>
	<p> 
	<b>Definition of <i>sedition</i> according to Collins Dictionary:</b><br>
	Sedition is speech, writing, or behaviour intended to encourage people to fight against or oppose the government.
	<br> <br> 
	<b>Examples of <i>sedition</i> crimes in the past with the absence of technology</b><br>
	Pedro Albizu Campos, was convicted of sedition in 1937 and jailed for 10 years for attempting to overthrow the US government. He and others had been <br>
	active members of the Nationalist Party, which was aimed at gaining independence through force ("Sedition," n.d).
	<br> <br>

	<b>How have technology evolved the way <i>sedition</i> is committed?</b><br>
	Sedition groups such as ISIS are known for using online, end-to-end messaging applications such as Telegram and WhatsApp. These apps are not only widely 
	used, but are also heavily encrypted, making their conversations more secure and protected (Acolola, 2017).
	<br> <br>
	<b> What are actions/responses that may mitigate the effect of technology on <i>sedition</i> ? </b><br>
	Actions that may be taken to mitigate the effect of this is by monitoring social media and other platforms to track sedition acts or to determine if what 
	is being communicated is an act of sedition.
	
	<br> <br>
	<b>How can <i>sedition</i> be mitigated with the use of technology?</b><br>
	Surveillance cameras can be used to mitigate sedition. Through surveillance, the government can see what is happening in their country and stop acts of <br>
	sedition in its development phase before it gets bigger.
	<br> <br> <br>
	
	<h2 id = "bottom">Treason</h2>
	<p> 
	<b>Definition of <i>treason</i> according to Collins Dictionary:</b><br>
	Treason is the crime of betraying your country, for example by helping its enemies or by trying to remove its government using violence.
	<br> <br> 
	<b>Examples of <i>treason</i> crimes in the past with the absence of technology</b><br>
	Historical example of someone convicted of treason in the United States is General Benedict Arnold. Benedict Arnold, an officer in the Revolutionary Army, <br>
	gave the plans for West Point, a military installation, to the British enemy during the Revolutionary War in exchange for money and a post in the British <br>
	army ("Treason," n.d).
	<br> <br>

	<b>How have technology evolved the way <i>treason</i> is committed?</b><br>
	Nowadays, treason can be committed using technology. Individuals can use computers to hack into the pentagon and launch unauthorized missiles, tap into 
	different cameras such as the cameras in the white house and gain unauthorized information and they can also control a country's power grid and control 
	a whole country or city.
	<br> <br>
	<b> What are actions/responses that may mitigate the effect of technology on <i>treason</i>? </b><br>
	To mitigate the effect of cyber treason, the government designs special software to locate malicious programs quickly and also encrypt information on 
	government owned computers.

	<br> <br>
	<b>How can <i>treason</i> be mitigated with the use of technology?</b><br>
	Treason attacks on helicopters by rocket - propelled grenades have cause many deaths. In response to this, NATO has begun developing packages to address 
	self-protection and threat detection for helicopters, as well as means of countering these threats. NATO is now examining how technologies such as air bags 
	and flak-resistant seats as well as RPG-resistant coatings (Billingslea, 2004).
