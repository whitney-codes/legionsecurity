	<h2 id="top"> OPPORTUNITIES </h2>
	Although there are many threats and challenges when it comes to technology, there are also opportunities that comes with it. <br>
	Technology constantly changes and provide us with new ideas, job opportunities, new ways of doing business, new products, <br>
	new ways to make a difference and a new way of living our lives (Australian Computer Society, 2016).

	<b>Technology as wealth creation</b><br><br>
	The benefits of technology have created tremendous wealth over the last decade companies like Google, Apple, or Facebook have <br>
	taken over the world. We live in a digital era where everything from your car to your fridge, your children's toys and even <br>
	the clothes you wear are connected to technology.  This alone adds to great economic opportunities. To get the most out of <br>
	this opportunity, gadgets and networks they communicate on must be secure which means cybersecurity must be apart of all new <br>
	technology going forward. Good cybersecurity ensures profitability is protected, prevents misuse of information, prevent theft <br>
	and will require cybersecurity products such as firewalls and antivirus software (Australian Computer Society, 2016). <br> <br> <br>

	<b>Cybersecurity as job growth</b><br><br>
	According to SEEK, cybersecurity roles are already in demand. This includes jobs like Security Analyst, Security Architect, <br>
	Security Engineer, and Chief Information Security Officer, all of which represent the new type of opportunities that are <br>
	developing in the workforce. Countries and businesses can capitalize on this growth, which will see more demand as the <br>
	importance of cybersecurity in the development of new technologies and products continues to grow. Israel have moved from a <br>
	high proportion of agricultural exports to software being its primary export and now leading the world, after the United States <br>
	of America, in cybersecurity (Australian Computer Society, 2016).<br> <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 id="bottom">Challenges</h2>
	While the opportunities are clear, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed.

	<b>Collaboration</b> <br> <br>
	Analysis of attacks over the years have revealed that cybercriminals work together well: sharing knowledge of exploits, selling <br>
	stolen data in an open market, and working together to develop new hacking techniques for infiltration. By contrast, those who <br>
	defend against cyberattacks: isolated  security vendors with competing products, little co-operation between government and industry,
	and companies afraid to share that they've been hacked for fear of impacting share price and exposure. Therefore, developing the 
	knowledge and software to protect against cyberattacks cannot happen in a vacuum. No one company or security vendor is able to fight 
	against an opponent who collaborates. This is a key lesson many in the private sector will have to learn (Australian Computer Society, 2016).<br> <br> <br>

	<b>Education and awareness</b><br><br> 
	As society move to a knowledge economy, they will be more need for scientists, mathematicians, engineers and programmers. Promotion <br>
	and support of STEM subjects in schools, expanded degrees specific to cybersecurity at university, and an increased emphasis on <br> 
	entrepreneurial businesses skills will all help get contribute to bettering cybersecurity (Australian Computer Society, 2016).<br> <br>
