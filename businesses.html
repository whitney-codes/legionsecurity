	<b>Three types of crimes against individuals include: </b><br>
	<ul>
	<li>Industrial Esponiage</li><br>
	<li>Money Laundering</li><br>
	<li>Extortion</li>
	</ul>
	<br> <br> <br>
	<h2 id="top" >Industrial Esponiage</h2>
	<p> 
	
	<b>Definition of <i>industrial esponiage</i> according to Collins Dictionary:</b><br>
	attempting to obtain trade secrets by dishonest means, as by telephone- or computer-tapping, infiltration of a competitor's workforce.
	<br> <br> 
	<b>Examples of <i>industrial esponiage</i> crimes in the past with the absence of technology</b><br>
	In 2001 rival consumer good corporations used industrial esponiage. Proctor and Gamble workers went undercover as dumpster <br>
	divers and went through Unilever's trash in search of intel that might enable the company to gain an edge over their rival.

	<br> <br>
	<b>How have technology evolved the way <i>industrial esponiage </i> is committed?</b><br>
	Today most of the interesting data is stored on computer systems. One of the most successful technologies in unauthorized deploying and <br>
	installing software on systems are worms, viruses and other malware by email spam, internet spam or any other means (Schulz, 2006).
	<br> <br>
	<b> What are actions/responses that may mitigate the effect of technology on <i>industrial esponiage</i> ? </b><br>
    To mitigate the effect of this companies are encouraged to do checks on the system as often as possible for any worms, viruses or any other
	problems on their computer systems. An antivirus system is used as a protection against this and some can even be used to trace the origin of virus 
	("Learn about malware and how to protect all your devices against it," n.d).
	
	<br> <br>
	<b>How can <i>hacking</i> be mitigated with the use of technology?</b><br>
	Hacking is type of industrial espionage that can be mitigated by installing protections, updating firewalls and updating virus databases.
	<br> <br> <br>
	
	<h2 id = "middle">Money Laundering</h2>
	<p> 
	<b>Definition of <i>Money laundering</i> according to Collins Dictionary:</b><br>
	Money laundering is the crime of processing stolen money through a legitimate business or sending it abroad to a foreign bank, to hide the fact that <br>
	the money was illegally obtained.
	<br> <br> 
	<b>Examples of <i>money laundering</i> crimes in the past with the absence of technology</b><br>
	Money laundering is first seen with individuals hiding wealth from the state to avoid taxation or confiscation or a combination of both <br>
	(Money Laundering - Then and Now, 2016).

	<br> <br>
	<b>How have technology evolved the way <i>money laundering</i> is committed?</b><br>
	Legitimate websites are being used as payment processors to launder vast amounts of money. Drugs can be ordered online and the transaction will appear 
	as something harmless on your statement, such as a flowers purchase. Last year it was alleged that an ISIS operative in the US had used eBay to 'sell'
	computer printers and received payments for these transactions from overseas via PayPal (Bell, 2018).
	<br> <br>
	<b> What are actions/responses that may mitigate the effect of technology on <i>money laundering</i> ? </b><br>
	New innovations in technology are being created to monitor transactions and are being used to help identify suspicious behaviour and patterns amongst 
	legitimate payments and interactions (Bell, 2018).
	
	<br> <br>
	<b>How can <i>embezzlement</i> be mitigated with the use of technology?</b><br>
	Embezzlement which is a type of money laundering can be mitigated using accounting packages, like operating systems, which are continously being <br>
	patched due to newly discovered vulnerabilities which are used by employees to commit fraud (Hammarberg, 2015).
	<br> <br> <br>
	
	<h2 id = "bottom">Extortion</h2>
	<p> 
	<b>Definition of <i>extortion</i> according to Collins Dictionary:</b><br>
	Extortion is the crime of obtaining something from someone, especially money, by using force or threats.
	<br> <br> 
	<b>Examples of <i>extortion</i> crimes in the past with the absence of technology</b><br>
	Before the emergence of technology, extortion was done using industrial espionage to get information about a business or company and forcing these <br>
	business to give criminals money to prevent sensitive information would from being released.
	
	<br> <br>
	<img src="ext.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right" alt = "photo">
	<b>How have technology evolved the way <i>extortion</i> is committed?</b><br>
	In a common form of cyber extortion, the victim receives an email saying that their information will be released to the public, their family, and 
	their friends if a ransom is not paid. Criminals may say that they have placed software on the victim's computer that allowed them to steal documents, 
    photos, passwords, or other sensitive information.
	<br> <br>
	<b> What are actions/responses that may mitigate the effect of technology on <i>extortion</i>? </b><br>
	Don't give out sensitive information such as passwords to anyone and be careful of what you download and the websites yo go on because these might have <br>
	spyware.
	
	</a>
	<br> <br>
	<b>How can <i>extortion</i> be mitigated with the use of technology?</b><br>
	Extortion can be mitigated using technology when a software distributor announces updates for programs and software, users should install them as soon as <br>
	possible. Most times softwares are updated because there might be vulnerability in current versions.
